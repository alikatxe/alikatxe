# Using Loop Function
# for() loop
# 1. Using the for loop, create an R script that will display a 5x5 matrix as shown in Figure 1. It must contain vectorA = [1,2,3,4,5] and a 5 x 5 zero matrix.
# Hint Use abs() function to get the absolute value
```{r}
VectorA <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
matrix <- matrix(0, nrow = 5, ncol = 5)
for (i in 1:5) {
  matrix[i, ] <- VectorA
}

matrix
```

# 2. Print the string "*" using for() function. The output should be the same as shown in Figure
